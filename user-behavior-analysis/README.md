# User Behavior Analysis (Academic Simulation Project)

## Objective
Analyze synthetic user session data to identify high bounce pages and simulate A/B testing for conversion uplift.

## Tools Used
- Excel
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

## Approach
- Simulated session logs including page visits, durations, bounces
- Identified bottlenecks and drop-off pages
- Ran A/B test simulation (homepage variation)

## Result
Projected a +12% uplift in conversion based on synthetic variant group performance.
